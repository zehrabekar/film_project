# 🎬 Film Archive App

## 📌 Description  
This project is a simple film archive web app built with **JavaScript (ES6)**.  
It allows users to add films (with title, director, and poster image URL), display them in a table, store them in **localStorage**, and delete or clear all films.  
The project was developed as part of a **JavaScript course** on Udemy and was created by following the instructor’s guidance.
